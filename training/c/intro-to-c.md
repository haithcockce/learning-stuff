# Basics of C Code

## Writing Code

### Overview

- _Source_ typically refers to the code itself
- _Compile_ translate human-readable source code into machine-readable binary to run
- _Executable_ a file of raw binary code typically made from compiled source code which is loaded into memory and ran 
- _Expression_ like math, some logic that, when executed, has some sort of result, like 1 + 2 is an expression that results in 3
- _Variable_ something that represents a value. Like in math, x = 2, x is the variable whose value is 2.
- _Function_ a series of lines of code that, when executed, performs some objective
- _Parameter_ the value provided to a variable going into a function. For example, with the pythagorean theorem, $a^2$
- _Library_ source code already written elsewhere but imported into your code. Referred to as packages in Java, modules in Python, etc
- _Type_ what kind of object is it? Is it a number? Is it a string? Is it something else? 

C-Specific stuff

- _Function Prototype_ defines how you interact with a function such as
